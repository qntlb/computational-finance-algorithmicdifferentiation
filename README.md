# Computational Finance Lecture - Algorithmic Differentiation

This repository contains a simple implementation of an adjoint algorithmic differentiation
(backward algorithmic differentiation, backward automatic differentiation) (AAD).

The material is used during the lecture *Applied Mathematical Finance* / *Computational Finance 2* (Winter 2020/2021).
